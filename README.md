# Gibbs-Energy-Minimization

## Description
The software represents an implementation of the Gibbs-energy minimization method [1, 2] to derive the equilibrium composition for reacting systems. Fugacity coefficients are calculated by Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state [3]. Acentric factors and critical properties are obtained from [2] and Gibbs free energy of formation data from [4].

## Usage
Details will be added.

If the requirements (provided in requirements.txt) are fulfilled the Python-file can be executed and a comparison of the simulated chemical equilibrium with data provided in [1] is shown graphically.

## Project status
The current state is that the implementation is being validated for methanation (hydrogenation of CO2 into CH4) with data provided in [1].
