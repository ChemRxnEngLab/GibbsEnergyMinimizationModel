# Gibbs-Energy-Minimization

## Description
The software represents an implementation of the Gibbs-energy minimization method to derive the equilibrium composition for reacting systems.

## Usage
Details will be added.

If the requirements (provided in requirements.txt) are fulfilled the Python-file can be executed and a comparison of the simulated chemical equilibrium with data provided in [1] is shown graphically.
